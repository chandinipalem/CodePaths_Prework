An app I would like to build is a party game app. Though I haven't thought of every detail, I was inspired by among us and jubillee videos. The game will consist of multiple players, but one is an imposter. A theme will be sent to everyone's phone (except 1 person's). The app will randomly chose players to say something about the theme (an adjective, a phrase, an opinion, it can be anything!) and the imposter has to try their best to stay hidden and use what other people say as clues to stay on theme. At the end of the round, the players will vote who they think the imposter is. By the end of the game if the imposter does not get voted out, they secure a point. This app will need a game code, a text box for players to enter their names, a random theme generator, a voting option, etc. Also a settings so players can edit how many imposters they want, select certain themes, etc.  


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. I did not face any challenged when building this app
